# Grindios
A discord chatting bot to help you level up in discord. to use this program you can either use the compiled binary (a ready-to-use exe for windows) or inspect and compile the code yourself.

## How to use
the program is simple just make sure you are using a disposable discord account because using this software is against Discords TOS and can get you banned. its optional but preferably you should run this software in a virtual machine.
1. make sure your discord account is already in the discord and has access to the channel you want to chat in
2. run the program (double click the exe duh)
4. give him the channel link (you can create it by clicking on the "+" button next to the channel name)
5. give him the delay between each message he sends (i recommend increasing the delay to like 1-2 minutes because if he talks a lot it will be obvious that it is a bot)
6. for the first time it may take some time to launch the browser because it has to be downloaded

## Get the compiled executable 
1. go to [releases](https://github.com/YB-42/grindios2/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
2. download the grandios.exe 
   
## Compile and run the code yourself
1. download the Dart SDK from [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
    1. if you are on windows and don't have chocolatey installed install it from [here](https://chocolatey.org/install)
   2. make sure you add dart SDK to your system environment variables the instructions are there
   3. check if you have the dart binary installed by opening a terminal and running the command `dart`
2. download this repo by clicking on the green button up top on this page then clicking download zip
3. unzip it go to that folder in the terminal 
   1. in windows just enter the folder with explorer and type cmd in the explorer path and hit enter
4. run `dart run` to run the program or use `dart compile exe` to compile it
